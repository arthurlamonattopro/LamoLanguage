# Lamo Directory Layout Strategy

**Status:** Official (Foundation decision, tracked in `todo.md` Phase
"Foundation: Define a clear directory strategy").
This document records WHERE compiler stages, runtime code, tests and tooling
live and WHY, so new work has an unambiguous home.

## Top level

```
lamo                  # compiler binary (built; not committed)
Makefile              # one-command build + `make test`
scripts/              # build-time generators (not shipped with the binary)
src/                  # the compiler itself (C99)
std/                  # standard library modules (.lamo) + docs (.md) + tests
tests/                # regression corpus for the COMPILER
examples/             # end-user example programs
docs/                 # authoritative design documents & this file
```

## src/ — compiler stages, in pipeline order

The compile pipeline is:

```
source text ─▶ lexer ─▶ parser ─▶ AST ─▶ import resolver ─▶ semantic pass ─▶ codegen ─▶ lamo_exec.c ─▶ C compiler
                                                    │                        │
                                                 modules.c              lamo_runtime.h (embedded)
```

| Path                    | Stage / responsibility |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `src/lamo_v2.c`         | `main()` + subcommand dispatch only (kept thin by design) |
| `src/cli/`              | CLI layer: option parsing, per-subcommand handlers, the compile pipeline driver (`compile.c`), import resolution (`import_resolver.c`), help text |
| `src/lexer/`            | Lexing: source → tokens |
| `src/parser/`           | Parsing: tokens → AST (including all generics syntax) |
| `src/ast/`              | AST node definitions, constructors and `ast_free` |
| `src/semantic/`         | The semantic pass: symbol tables, scoping, type checking, generics binding, constraint catalogue |
| `src/codegen/`          | C backend: AST → C (codegen.c), embedded runtime string data, and **the runtime itself lives in one header**, see below |
| `src/eval/`             | Tree-walking interpreter backing `lamo eval` / `lamo repl` (fast-feedback path; deliberately NOT module-capable — SPEC §10.7) |
| `src/lampm/`            | Integrated package manager (`lamo install`, …); linked into the same binary |
| `src/modules.c/.h`      | Module registry used by namespaced imports |
| `src/builtins.h`        | Single source of truth for every builtin (name, arity, category, return policy). Adding a builtin starts here. |
| `src/error_util.h`      | Shared error formatting: `file:line:col`, caret snippets, hints, color |

Rules of thumb that keep the split honest:

1. **Frontend vs backend boundary**: everything up to and including
   `src/semantic/` is the frontend; `src/codegen/` is the backend. The
   backend must derive its decisions from semantic annotations on AST nodes
   (e.g. `sema_struct_name`, `sema_full_type`) rather than re-deriving facts.
   See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. **One builtin = three edits maximum**: `builtins.h` entry, runtime function
   in `lamo_runtime.h`, codegen case. Anything more is a bug in the layout.
3. Diagnostics always render through `error_util.h`.

## Runtime

`src/codegen/lamo_runtime.h` is a real, compilable header maintained like any
other source file. `scripts/embed_runtime.py` converts it into
`src/codegen/lamo_runtime_data.c`, which is committed to the repo so builds do
not require Python. `make embed-runtime` regenerates it whenever the header
changes; `make` does this automatically.

## Tests

```
tests/
├── valid/       # programs that MUST pass `lamo check`
├── invalid/     # programs that MUST fail `lamo check`
├── runtime/     # programs run via `lamo run`, stdout compared to .expected
│   └── import_dup/  # multi-file fixtures may live next to their test
├── smoke/       # parser/diagnostic smoke cases:
│                 # NAME.expect_err pins required stderr substrings on failure,
│                 # NAME.expect_ok pins warnings while requiring success,
│                 # no directive file => must succeed silently.
├── golden/      # generated-C snapshot diffs (NAME.lamo + NAME.c.expected)
└── fixtures/    # helper files imported by tests above
```

Standard library module tests live beside the stdlib they cover:
`std/tests/*.lamo`, executed as part of `make test`. Each module pairs its
implementation (`std/<name>.lamo`) with documentation (`std/<name>.md`) and a
demonstration (`std/examples/<name>_demo.lamo`).

## Adding a new feature, path-wise

- New syntax → `src/parser/` (+ AST node if needed) → `src/semantic/` checks
  → SPEC section → both a `valid` and where relevant an `invalid` test, plus a
  `smoke` case pinning at least one real diagnostic message.
- New statement/expression lowering only → `src/codegen/` + a `golden`
  snapshot so future refactors can't silently change output shape.
- New standard library surface → `std/<module>.lamo` + `.md` docs + demo +
  entries in `std/tests`.
