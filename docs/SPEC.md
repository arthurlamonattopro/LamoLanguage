# Lamo Language Specification

**Version:** 1.0 (matches compiler `2.2.0`)
**Status:** Authoritative. When this document and the compiler disagree, the **compiler is the bug** (for spec'd behavior) or the **spec is the bug** (for unspecified behavior). Either way, file an issue.

This document defines Lamo's syntax, static semantics, runtime semantics,
memory model, and standard library contract. It is the single source of truth
for "what the language means" — independent of any specific backend (today the
C transpiler; future interpreters or VMs must conform to this spec, not the
other way around).

## 1. Lexical Structure

### 1.1 Source format

- Source files use the `.lamo` extension.
- Source encoding is **UTF-8**. The lexer treats bytes 0x80–0xFF as part of
  string literals but does not perform Unicode normalization. Identifiers are
  restricted to ASCII (see §1.5).
- Both LF and CRLF line endings are accepted. The lexer normalizes CRLF to LF
  internally before tokenizing, so line/column numbers are consistent.
- A file MUST end with a newline. The formatter (`lamo fmt`) enforces this.

### 1.2 Comments

- `//` begins a line comment that runs to the end of the line. Block comments
  are not supported.
- Comments are stripped by the lexer and produce no tokens.

```lamo
let x = 5;       // this is a comment
let y = x + 1;   // so is this
```

### 1.3 Whitespace

Whitespace (space, tab, CR, LF) separates tokens but is otherwise insignificant.
The formatter normalizes tabs to 4 spaces, but the lexer accepts either.

### 1.4 Literals

| Literal kind        | Syntax                                          | Type      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Integer (decimal)   | `42`, `0`, `-5` (unary minus on literal)        | `int`     |
| Integer (hex)       | `0xFF`, `0x1A2B`                                | `int`     |
| Integer (binary)    | `0b1010`, `0b0001`                              | `int`     |
| Integer (underscore)| `1_000_000`, `0xFF_FF`                          | `int`     |
| Float               | `3.14`, `0.5`, `2.0`                            | `float`   |
| String              | `"abc"`, `"with\nescapes"`                      | `string`  |
| Boolean             | `true`, `false`                                 | `bool`    |

`int` is a 64-bit signed integer (C `long long` on most platforms). Float is
IEEE 754 double-precision (C `double`).

#### String escapes

Inside a `"..."` literal, the following escapes are recognized:

| Escape  | Meaning                          |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| `\n`    | newline (0x0A)                   |
| `\t`    | horizontal tab (0x09)            |
| `\r`    | carriage return (0x0D)           |
| `\\`    | backslash                        |
| `\"`    | double quote                     |
| `\0`    | null byte (0x00)                 |
| `\xNN`  | byte with hex value NN           |

Any other `\X` is a **lexical error**. Raw newlines inside a string literal
are also a lexical error — use `\n` instead.

### 1.5 Identifiers

An identifier is `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. Identifiers are case-sensitive.
`foo` and `Foo` are distinct.

### 1.6 Keywords

The following identifiers are reserved and cannot be used as variable or
function names:

```
let fn if else while for return break continue
import as struct impl enum match true false
int float bool string void array
```

`pub`, `match`, `self`, and `std` are contextually reserved: `self` is only
meaningful inside an `impl` block; `std` is a path prefix in `import std.X`
(see §10).

### 1.7 Operators and punctuation

```
+  -  *  /  %         arithmetic
+= -= *= /= %=        compound assignment
=                     assignment
== != < <= > >=        comparison
&& || !               logical
++ --                 increment / decrement
(  )  [  ]  {  }       grouping / array / block
,  ;  :  ->  .         punctuation
```

`;` is optional at the end of a statement (see §3.1).

## 2. Grammar (informal)

This section gives an informal EBNF-ish grammar. Where the grammar is
ambiguous, the prose in §3–§9 wins. The parser is recursive descent and uses
the precedence in §6.2.

```
program       := top_decl*
top_decl      := import_decl
              | struct_decl
              | enum_decl

assign_stmt   := lvalue ('=' | '+=' | '-=') expr
              | lvalue '++'
              | lvalue '--'
lvalue        := IDENT
              | IDENT '[' expr ']'
              | IDENT '.' IDENT
              | expr '.' IDENT          // for `obj.field = x`

array_lit     := '[' (expr (',' expr)*)? ']'
struct_lit    := IDENT '{' field_init (',' field_init)* '}'
field_init    := IDENT ':' expr
```

---

## 3. Top-Level Declarations

### 3.1 Semicolon rules

A statement may be terminated by an optional `;`. Both forms are accepted:

```lamo
let x = 5
let y = 6;
```

This is intentional: REPL one-liners feel lighter without `;`, while
multi-statement lines in real files stay readable with `;`. The parser treats
a newline as a soft terminator — if the next token would extend the current
statement (e.g. a binary operator), parsing continues across the newline.

### 3.2 `let` declarations

`let name = expr` declares a variable in the current scope. The variable's
type is inferred from `expr` (see §7.1). An optional annotation `let name: T = expr`
asserts that the inferred type is `T` — if it isn't, the compiler emits a type
error. The annotation does **not** cause a coercion; it only checks.

`let` is also valid at the top level. Top-level `let`s become global mutable
variables (not constants). Their initializers run in `main()` before user
code, in declaration order. This means user functions that reference a global
see the initialized value, not zero.

### 3.3 `fn` declarations

```
fn name(param_list) -> ReturnType { body }
```

- Parameters may have type annotations: `fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int`.
- The return type annotation `-> T` is optional. If present, `return` statements
  inside the body are checked against it (see §7.3). If absent, the return type
  is inferred from the first `return` (best-effort; mixed `return 5` and
  `return "x"` in the same function is a type error).
- A function with no `return` and no return-type annotation has return type
  `void`.
- Functions are **not hoisted**. A function must be declared before it is
  called. This is enforced by the semantic pass walking top-level declarations
  in source order. (Mutual recursion therefore requires a forward-declaration
  mechanism, which is future work — see §13.)
- Functions may be recursive (self-reference is allowed within the body).
- Functions may not be nested. There are no closures.

### 3.4 `struct` declarations

```
struct Player {
    name: string,
    hp: int,
    level: int
}
```

- Fields are separated by `,`, `;`, or newlines (any mix).
- Every field MUST have a type annotation. The annotation may be `int`,
  `float`, `bool`, `string`, `array`, or another struct name.
- Field types are annotations only at runtime — Lamo is dynamically typed at
  the value level (see §7.4) — but the compiler uses them for static field
  validation. Accessing a non-declared field is a compile-time error.
- Structs may not contain themselves by value (no direct recursion). A struct
  may contain an `array` of its own type.

### 3.5 `enum` declarations

```
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}
```

- Each variant becomes a top-level `int` constant (`Red = 0`, `Green = 1`, …).
- Variants are accessible by bare name (no `Color::Red` qualifier).
- Variant names must be unique within their enum. Across enums, variant name
  collisions are allowed — the later declaration shadows the earlier (with a
  warning). This is a known wart; future tagged-enum support (§13) will fix
  this by requiring qualification.

### 3.6 `impl` blocks

```
impl Player {
    fn damage(amount: int) {
        self.hp -= amount
    }
}
```

- `impl Type { ... }` attaches methods to a previously-declared struct `Type`.
- Inside an `impl` method body, `self` refers to the receiver. It is implicit;
  do NOT declare it as a parameter.
- Methods are called as `obj.method(args)`. Method arity is validated at
  compile time.
- Methods can be chained: `p.damage(10).heal(5)` works if `damage` returns
  the receiver (today, methods that don't explicitly `return` return `void`).
- A method may be defined before or after the struct it operates on; the
  semantic pass runs in two phases (collect struct/enum/impl definitions,
  then visit function bodies).

### 3.7 `import` declarations

See §10.

---

## 4. Statements

### 4.1 `if` / `else`

```lamo
if (cond) { ... }
if (cond) { ... } else { ... }
if (cond) { ... } else if (other) { ... } else { ... }
```

The condition uses **Python-like truthiness** (see §7.5). The body is a block.
`else if` is parsed as `else { if (...) { ... } }`.

### 4.2 `while`

```lamo
while (cond) { ... }
```

Repeats the body while `cond` is truthy. `break` exits the loop; `continue`
jumps to the next iteration. Both are compile-time errors outside any loop.

### 4.3 `for`

```lamo
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ... }
```

C-style for. The init clause is a `let` or an assignment; the condition is an
expression; the update is an assignment (including `++` / `--`). Any of the
three may be omitted: `for (;;) { ... }` is an infinite loop.

There is no `for-in` / iterator form today. That is future work (§13).

### 4.4 `return`

```lamo
return expr
return          // bare return; function returns void
```

`return` outside a function is a compile-time error (top-level `return` was
rejected explicitly — the language does not have "script semantics" for it).
The expression's type is checked against the function's declared return type
when one is declared.

### 4.5 `break` and `continue`

Valid only inside `while` or `for`. Otherwise a semantic error.

### 4.6 `match`

```lamo
match color {
    Red => print("red"),
    Green => print("green"),
    _ => print("other")
}
```

- Patterns are enum variant names or `_` (wildcard).
- The first matching arm wins.
- Arm bodies can be a single expression or a `{ }` block.
- The compiler emits a warning when the scrutinee has a known enum type and
  not all variants are covered (and no `_` arm is present).
- Today, `match` only supports variant equality. Literal patterns, destructuring,
  and guards are future work (§13).

### 4.7 Assignment

```
lvalue = expr
lvalue += expr
lvalue -= expr
lvalue *= expr
lvalue /= expr
lvalue %= expr
lvalue ++
lvalue --
```

An `lvalue` is one of: a bare identifier, `arr[i]`, or `obj.field`. Compound
assignment desugars to read-then-write. `++` / `--` are sugar for `+= 1` /
`-= 1` (postfix semantics only; the value of the expression is the **new**
value, not the old).

Assignment is a **statement**, not an expression. `let x = (y = 5)` is a
syntax error.

---

## 5. Expressions

### 5.1 Literals

See §1.4.

### 5.2 Identifiers

A bare identifier resolves through the scope chain (§7.6). If the identifier
is a builtin (`print`, `input`, `isnumber`, …), it resolves to the builtin
function. User-defined functions shadow builtins.

### 5.3 Function calls

```
foo(arg1, arg2, ...)
```

The callee must be a function name (no first-class functions today). Argument
count is validated at compile time. Argument types are checked when the
function has annotations.

### 5.4 Method calls

```
obj.method(args)
```

`obj` must have a struct type. The method must be declared in some `impl Type`
block. Arity is validated.

### 5.5 Module member calls

```
alias.member(args)
```

`alias` must be a module alias introduced by `import "..." as alias;` or
`import std.X as alias`. `member` must be a top-level function in that module.
Arity is validated.

### 5.6 Indexing

```
arr[i]
```

`arr` must be an array. `i` may be negative (counts from the end: `arr[-1]`
is the last element). Out-of-bounds access is a runtime error.

### 5.7 Field access

```
obj.field
```

`obj` must be a struct. `field` must be a declared field. The result type is
the field's declared type.

For arrays, `arr.len` is the only supported property today (it is a method
call, not a field — `arr.len()`).

---

## 6. Operators

### 6.1 Operator semantics

| Operator | Int       | Float     | String             | Bool     |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|----------|
| `+`      | add       | add       | concat             | error    |
| `-`      | sub       | sub       | error              | error    |
| `*`      | mul       | mul       | error              | error    |
| `/`      | int div   | float div | error              | error    |
| `%`      | int mod   | float mod | error              | error    |
| `==`     | equality  | equality  | value equality     | equality |
| `!=`     | negation  | negation  | negation           | negation |
| `< <= > >=` | compare  | compare   | compare (lex)      | error    |
| `&&`     | error     | error     | error              | logical and (truthiness) |
| `\|\|`   | error     | error     | error              | logical or (truthiness)  |
| `!`      | error     | error     | error              | logical not            |
| unary `-`| negate    | negate    | error              | error    |

**Mixed numeric operands**: `int + float` is allowed; the result is `float`.
This is the only implicit conversion in the language. String concatenation
`"count: " + 42` is a **type error** — use string interpolation or explicit
conversion (today: `"count: " + to_string(42)` via std.string).

### 6.2 Precedence (lowest to highest)

```
||                          (left-assoc)
&&                          (left-assoc)
== !=                       (left-assoc)
< <= > >=                   (left-assoc)
+ -                         (left-assoc)
* / %                       (left-assoc)
unary - !                   (prefix)
postfix . [] ()             (postfix, left-assoc)
primary                     (atoms)
```

All binary operators are left-associative. There is no exponentiation operator
today (use `std.math.pow`).

### 6.3 Truthiness

Lamo uses Python-like truthiness, NOT strict-bool. The following table defines
what is considered "true" in `if`/`while`/`for` conditions and `&&`/`||`/`!`
operands:

| Type    | Truthy when                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `int`   | non-zero                             |
| `float` | non-zero                             |
| `bool`  | the value itself                     |
| `string`| non-empty                            |
| `array` | non-empty                            |
| struct  | always (TODO: define; today always)  |
| `void`  | compile-time error in boolean context |

This is a **deliberate language decision**, not an accident. If you want
strict bool, compare explicitly: `if (n > 0)`, `if (s != "")`.

---

## 7. Type System

### 7.1 Decision: hybrid inference

**Lamo uses a hybrid type system: local inference for `let`, optional
annotations on `fn`, mandatory annotations on struct fields.**

The full rationale is in `docs/TYPE-SYSTEM.md`. The short version:

1. **`let x = expr`** — type is inferred from `expr`. The annotation
   `let x: T = expr` is allowed and adds a compile-time check, but is never
   required.
2. **`fn name(params) -> T`** — parameter and return-type annotations are
   optional. When present, the compiler validates them strictly. When absent,
   the compiler does best-effort inference from `return` statements.
3. **`struct Name { field: T }`** — field annotations are **mandatory**. A
   struct without field types is a syntax error.
4. **Public API functions** — when `pub` is added (future), public functions
   MUST have full annotations on all parameters and the return type. Private
   functions may omit them. For now (no `pub` yet), the recommendation is:
   top-level functions that are called from other files SHOULD have full
   annotations; helpers local to a file may omit them.

This model was chosen over the alternatives for these reasons:

- **Full inference everywhere** (Option A) was rejected because it makes
  cross-file calls unreadable: with no annotations on `fn foo(a, b)`, the
  caller has no way to know what types `foo` expects without reading its body.
  For a transpiled language aiming at "small but real", this is too costly.
- **Mandatory annotations everywhere** (Option B) was rejected because it
  kills the "as simple as an interpreted language" promise: `let x = 5` is
  nicer than `let x: int = 5`, and we already have the type from the literal.
- **Hybrid** (Option C, chosen) keeps the lightweight feel for local code
  while making API boundaries explicit. It mirrors what TypeScript, modern
  Python (with PEP 484), and Scala do.

### 7.2 Built-in types

| Type    | Values                                  | C representation   |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `int`   | 64-bit signed integer                   | `long long`        |
| `float` | IEEE 754 double                         | `double`           |
| `bool`  | `true` / `false`                        | `int` (0 or 1)     |
| `string`| immutable UTF-8 byte sequence           | `char*` (NUL-term) |
| `void`  | unit type (no value)                    | `void`             |
| `array` | dynamic, heterogeneous                  | `LamoArray*`       |

User-defined types: `struct Name` (composite), `enum Name` (tagged int —
future tagged unions are §13).

### 7.3 Type checking rules

- **Arithmetic**: `int + int = int`, `float + float = float`, `int + float = float`
  (int is promoted). `string + string = string` (concat). Any other operand
  combination is a compile-time error.
- **Comparison**: same-type comparisons return `bool`. Mixed `int < float` is
  allowed (returns `bool`). `string < string` is lexicographic. Comparing
  different-type values (`int == string`) is a compile-time error.
- **Logical**: `&&`, `||`, `!` operate on truthiness. The result type is the
  type of the operand(s), not `bool` — this matches Python and JavaScript
  semantics (`5 || 0` returns `5`, not `true`). If you need `bool`, compare
  explicitly.
- **Assignment**: the RHS type must be compatible with the LHS's known type
  (declared for `let`, inferred from prior assignment for plain `x = ...`).
  Incompatible assignment is a compile-time error.
- **Function return**: when a function has a declared return type, every
  `return expr` must have a type compatible with it. When the return type is
  omitted, the compiler infers it from the first `return`; subsequent `return`s
  must match.
- **Function call**: argument types are checked against parameter annotations
  when present. Arity is always checked.

### 7.4 Static vs. dynamic typing

Lamo is **statically checked at the operator level** but **dynamically typed
at the value level**. Concretely:

- The compiler rejects `"abc" * 3` at compile time (operator type check).
- The compiler does NOT reject:

  ```lamo
  let x = 5
  if (cond) { x = "abc" }   // legal at compile time, but the variable's
                            // inferred type is now "int or string"
  ```

  This is a known limitation. A future "gradual typing" pass (§13) may tighten
  this. For now, the rule is: **don't rebind a variable to a different type**.
  The compiler emits a warning (not an error) when it can detect this.

- Struct field types are checked at field access time (the compiler knows the
  field's declared type), but field writes are not strictly type-checked
  (writing `p.hp = "abc"` compiles, but reading `p.hp` later will produce
  wrong runtime behavior). Future work: tighten field-write checks.

### 7.5 Truthiness (formal)

A value `v` is truthy iff:

- `v` is `int` and `v != 0`
- `v` is `float` and `v != 0.0`
- `v` is `bool` and `v == true`
- `v` is `string` and `strlen(v) > 0`
- `v` is `array` and `v.len() > 0`
- `v` is a struct (always truthy today; future: define per-type)

Using `void` in a boolean context is a compile-time error.

### 7.6 Scopes

Lamo has four scope kinds:

1. **Global** — top-level `let`, `fn`, `struct`, `enum`, `impl` declarations.
2. **Function** — parameters and the function body.
3. **Block** — `{ ... }` inside a function or method body.
4. **Module** — names introduced by `import "..." as alias;` (§10).

Variable shadowing is allowed at any scope boundary. Re-declaration in the
**same** scope is a compile-time error (with a hint pointing at the previous
declaration).

Closures are not supported: a function inside another function would capture
the enclosing scope, but Lamo functions are top-level only. This is a
deliberate simplification.

## 8. Built-in Functions

These are treated as ordinary identifiers and may be shadowed by user
functions. The semantic pass resolves them via a builtin table.

| Name            | Arity | Signature                                  | Returns  | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|----------|-------|
| `print`         | 1     | `print(x: any) -> void`                    | `void`   | prints `x` followed by newline |
| `input`         | 0     | `input() -> int`                           | `int`    | reads a line, parses as int |
| `input_int`     | 0     | `input_int() -> int`                       | `int`    | alias for `input` |
| `input_str`     | 0     | `input_str() -> string`                    | `string` | reads a line as string |
| `isnumber`      | 1     | `isnumber(x: any) -> bool`                 | `bool`   | true if `x` is int or float |
| `isstring`      | 1     | `isstring(x: any) -> bool`                 | `bool`   | true if `x` is string |
| `isarray`       | 1     | `isarray(x: any) -> bool`                  | `bool`   | true if `x` is array |
| `len`           | 1     | `len(arr: array) -> int`                   | `int`    | same as `arr.len()` |
| `push`          | 2     | `push(arr: array, x: any) -> void`         | `void`   | same as `arr.push(x)` |
| `pop`           | 1     | `pop(arr: array) -> any`                   | any      | same as `arr.pop()` |
| `abs`           | 1     | `abs(x: int\|float) -> int\|float`         | mirror   | absolute value, mirrors arg type |
| `exit`          | 1     | `exit(code: int) -> void`                  | `void`   | terminates with exit code |

Platform-specific builtins (GUI, HTTP) are documented in §11.

---

## 9. Arrays

### 9.1 Literals and indexing

```lamo
let xs = [1, 2, 3]
let mixed = [1, "two", true]   // heterogeneous — legal but discouraged
print(xs[0])                   // 1
print(xs[-1])                  // 3 (negative index from end)
xs[0] = 99                     // index assignment
xs[0] += 1                     // read-modify-write on index
```

Arrays are dynamic and heterogeneous. The element type is not enforced
statically (a known limitation; future generics — §13 — will allow typed
arrays).

### 9.2 Methods

```
arr.push(x)    // append
arr.pop()      // remove and return last
arr.len()      // length
```

These are equivalent to the `push(arr, x)`, `pop(arr)`, `len(arr)` builtins.

### 9.3 Memory

Arrays are heap-allocated and managed by the runtime. Since compiler
2.3.0, Lamo ships an **opt-in mark-sweep garbage collector** (see
`docs/MEMORY-MODEL.md` for the full design). An array's memory is freed
when:

- the program exits (via `atexit` cleanup — always), OR
- a `gc_collect()` run determines the array is no longer reachable from
  any root (only when the user opts into GC via `gc_collect()` or
  `gc_set_threshold(N > 0)`).

Programs that never call `gc_*` see the same behavior as 2.2.0:
allocations accumulate until exit. Programs that opt in get periodic
reclamation during the run, which is what makes long-running processes
(HTTP servers, GUI event loops) viable.

The HTTP server loop and the GUI event loop both call `gc_collect()`
automatically on a fixed schedule (every 100 HTTP requests, every 1000
GUI frames). Programs can also call `gc_collect()` manually at natural
boundaries, or set an auto-trigger threshold with
`gc_set_threshold(N_bytes)`.

---

## 10. Modules and Imports

Lamo has three import forms. All three are language-level constructs (parsed
by the parser, not preprocessed by the CLI).

### 10.1 Legacy global merge

```lamo
import "math.lamo";
```

Loads `math.lamo` (resolved relative to the importing file's directory) and
merges every top-level declaration into the global namespace. This is the
original behavior and is kept for backwards compatibility. Use it for quick
scripts; for anything structured, prefer the namespaced form.

### 10.2 Namespaced string-path import

```lamo
import "math.lamo" as math;
math.sqrt(25)        // 5 (well, in this example, 625 — see README)
```

Loads `math.lamo` and exposes its top-level functions and globals under the
`math` alias. Calls go through `alias.member(args)` syntax. The loader renames
the imported declarations to `lamo_mod_<alias>__<name>` internally to avoid
collisions with the importing file's own declarations.

### 10.3 Bare-identifier import

```lamo
import math          // sugar for: import "math.lamo" as math
import math as m     // sugar for: import "math.lamo" as m
```

Resolves `math` to `math.lamo` in the importing file's directory. Otherwise
identical to §10.2.

### 10.4 Standard library imports

```lamo
import std.io
import std.math as math
```

Resolves `std.io` to `std/io.lamo`, searched in this order (first match wins):

1. `$LAMO_STD_DIR/io.lamo` (env override, dev/CI use)
2. `<bindir>/std/io.lamo` (shipped alongside the compiler binary)
3. `<bindir>/../std/io.lamo` (development layout)
4. `<bindir>/../share/lamo/std/io.lamo` (system install)
5. `./std/io.lamo` (current working directory)
6. `<importing_file_dir>/std/io.lamo` (local override)

This lets users override individual stdlib modules by placing files in `./std/`
next to their program.

### 10.5 Resolution and cycles

- Imports are resolved **lazily** during compilation: when the parser sees an
  `import` AST node, the loader resolves the path, reads the file, parses it,
  and recursively loads its imports.
- **Import cycles** are detected and reported as a compile-time error, with a
  stack showing the cycle: `a.lamo -> b.lamo -> a.lamo`.
- The same file imported twice (via different paths that normalize to the same
  absolute path) is loaded once. The second import is a no-op (its
  declarations are already in the aggregate program).
- Duplicate top-level symbol names across files produce a compile-time error
  with the file path of the previous declaration.

### 10.6 Visibility

Today, **every top-level declaration is public**. There is no `pub`/`priv`
distinction. This is fine for educational use but a wart for real projects.
Future: add `pub` keyword; only `pub` declarations are exported by a module
(see `todo.md` Phase 10).

### 10.7 Execution modes: `run` vs `eval`/`repl`

Lamo has two distinct execution paths with **different module-loading
capabilities**. This is a deliberate design decision, not a bug, and is
formalized here so users know which mode to use for which workload.

| Mode        | Backend              | Module imports (`import "..." as alias;`) | Speed     | Use case |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|
| `lamo run`  | Transpiles to C, GCC | Full `LamoModuleRegistry` support         | Native    | Programs that use namespaced imports (`math.sqrt(x)`, `fs.readText(path)`, …) and want maximum performance. |
| `lamo build`| Same as `run`, but stops after producing the binary | Full support | Native | Producing a distributable binary. |
| `lamo check`| Frontend only (lexer + parser + semantic) | Resolves imports for type/arity checking | Fast | CI / pre-commit validation. |
| `lamo eval` | Built-in tree-walking interpreter (`src/eval/eval.c`) | **No module registry** — `alias.member(args)` calls fail with a clear error pointing the user at `lamo run` | Slower (no GCC, no optimization) | Quick expression evaluation, REPL one-liners, debugging small snippets without the C-compile step. |
| `lamo repl` | Same interpreter as `eval`, interactive | **No module registry** (same as `eval`) | Slower | Interactive development. |

**Decision (formalized):** `eval`/`repl` and `run` are **distinct paths
with distinct purposes**. The interpreter path (`eval`/`repl`) is
optimized for fast feedback (no GCC invocation) and does NOT load
modules through the `LamoModuleRegistry`. Calling `math.sqrt(x)` in
`eval`/`repl` produces a clear error:

```
error: module member 'math.sqrt' is not available in eval/repl mode
hint: use `lamo run` to execute programs that use namespaced imports
```

Bringing the interpreter path to full parity with `run` (loading
modules, supporting namespaced calls) would require either (a)
implementing the module registry in the interpreter, or (b) compiling
every `eval`/`repl` input through the full `run` pipeline. Both options
sacrifice the "fast feedback" property that justifies having a separate
interpreter. We chose instead to make the limitation explicit and
documented.

**Migrating from `eval` to `run`:** if a snippet works in `eval` but
needs namespaced imports, save it to a `.lamo` file and run it with
`lamo run file.lamo`. The language semantics are otherwise identical
between the two paths — the interpreter implements the same value
model, truthiness rules, and runtime errors as the transpiler.

## 11. Platform-Specific Builtins

### 11.1 GUI (Windows-native, X11 on Linux/macOS)

| Builtin            | Signature                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `gui_open`         | `gui_open(w: int, h: int, title: string) -> void`      |
| `gui_should_close` | `gui_should_close() -> int`                            |
| `gui_begin_frame`  | `gui_begin_frame(r, g, b: int) -> void`                |
| `gui_draw_rect`    | `gui_draw_rect(x, y, w, h, r, g, b: int) -> void`      |
| `gui_draw_text`    | `gui_draw_text(text: string, x, y, r, g, b: int) -> void` |
| `gui_end_frame`    | `gui_end_frame() -> void`                              |
| `gui_close`        | `gui_close() -> void`                                  |

On platforms without a GUI backend, these compile to no-op stubs that emit a
runtime warning the first time they are called.

### 11.2 HTTP server

| Builtin          | Signature                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `http_route`     | `http_route(path: string, response: string) -> void`   |
| `http_serve`     | `http_serve(port: int) -> void`                        |
| `http_serve_once`| `http_serve_once(port: int) -> int`                    |

The HTTP server loop calls `gc_collect()` every 100 requests so the
arena doesn't grow without bound during long-running `http_serve`. The
route table itself (registered via `http_route`) is allocated outside
the GC heap (via plain `malloc`), so routes stay alive across
collections — only per-request garbage (string buffers built while
parsing/handling) is swept.

Programs that want finer control can call `gc_collect()` manually at
natural boundaries (end of request, after a batch of work) or set an
auto-trigger threshold via `gc_set_threshold(N_bytes)` — when the
runtime has allocated `N` bytes since the last collection, the next
allocation triggers a `gc_collect()`. See `docs/MEMORY-MODEL.md` for
the full GC design.

**Concurrency:** the server is single-threaded, one request at a time.
Multi-threaded HTTP is future work (depends on the broader threading
story for Lamo).

---

## 12. Runtime Behavior

### 12.1 Entry point

The entry point is the implicit `main()` synthesized by the codegen. It:

1. Initializes the string arena, the GC heap list, and the GC root stack.
2. Registers every global `LamoValue` (top-level `let`s) as a GC root.
3. Runs all top-level `let` initializers in declaration order.
4. Calls user `fn main()` if defined; otherwise runs top-level statements in
   order.
5. Pops all GC roots and cleans up the string arena via `atexit`.

There is no required `fn main()` today. Top-level statements run directly.
Defining `fn main()` is supported but optional — if present, it is called
after top-level initialization.

### 12.2 Integer overflow

`int` arithmetic wraps around on overflow (C `long long` semantics). There is
no overflow check today. Future: an `--overflow-check` flag may add trapping
semantics.

### 12.3 Division by zero

Integer division by zero terminates the program with a runtime error message
to stderr and exit code 134 (SIGABRT-style). Float division by zero produces
`inf` or `nan` (IEEE 754).

### 12.4 Array out-of-bounds

Accessing `arr[i]` with `i` outside `[-len, len-1]` terminates the program
with a runtime error and exit code 1.

### 12.5 Null pointers

Lamo does not have `null`. Uninitialized struct fields default to `0` (for
int/float/bool) or `""` (for string) or `[]` (for array). A field that should
be "absent" must be modeled explicitly (today: with an `int` flag; future:
with `Option<T>` once generics land — see `docs/RFC-generics.md`).

### 12.6 Error reporting

Runtime errors print `lamo: <kind> error: <message>` to stderr and exit 1.
`<kind>` is one of: `arithmetic`, `index`, `cast`, `internal`. There is no
exception system; runtime errors are fatal.

### 12.7 Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                |
|------|------------------------|
| 0    | success                |
| 1    | compile error OR runtime error |
| 2    | backend (C compile) failure |
| 134  | abort (e.g. assertion) |

## 13. Future Work (out of spec scope)

These items are tracked in `todo.md` and `roadmap.md` but are **NOT** part of
this spec. When they ship, this spec will be updated.

- **Generics** — typed arrays, `Option<T>`, `Result<T, E>`. Design draft in
  `docs/RFC-generics.md`.
- **First-class functions / closures** — `let f = fn(x) { ... }`.
- **Iterator protocol** — `for x in arr { ... }`.
- **Tagged unions / sum types** — `enum` carrying data, with destructuring in
  `match`.
- **Pattern matching** beyond variant equality — literals, guards,
  destructuring.
- **Exception / error-handling mechanism** — likely `Result<T, E>` based, not
  throw/catch.
- **`pub` visibility** — explicit module exports.
- **Forward declarations** for mutual recursion.
- **String interpolation** — `"hello \(name)"` or `` `hello ${name}` ``.
- **`for-in` loops** — `for x in arr { ... }`.
- **Gradual typing pass** — strict mode where rebinding to a different type
  is an error.
- **GC** — ~~mark-sweep for long-running programs; see `docs/MEMORY-MODEL.md`.~~
  **Shipped in 2.3.0.** Opt-in mark-sweep GC; see `docs/MEMORY-MODEL.md`.
  Future GC work: generational collection, incremental marking, concurrent
  collection (all depend on the threading story).
- **Modules with explicit exports** — `pub` keyword.

---

## 14. Changelog

- **v1.0** (this document) — first authoritative spec. Captures the behavior
  of compiler `2.2.0`. Future changes go through a formal revision process
  (TODO: define that process; for now, PR + spec bump).
- **v1.1** (compiler 2.3.0) — opt-in mark-sweep GC shipped
  (`docs/MEMORY-MODEL.md` Steps 2–6). New builtins: `gc_collect()`,
  `gc_set_threshold(N)`, `gc_heap_size()`, `gc_heap_count()`. HTTP server
  re-promoted from "preview" to "official". `eval`/`repl` vs `run`
  divergence formalized in §10.7.
